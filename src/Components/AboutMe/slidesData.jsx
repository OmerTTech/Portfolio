        Between 2022 and 2025 (at the age of 15–18), I completed 3 years of DUAL
        vocational education in ICT. During this time, I both studied
        theoretical subjects at school and worked in a company as part of my
        practical training.
        <br />
        <br />
        As part of this journey, my achievements were also featured on my
        vocational school’s official Instagram page, where I invited new
        students to join through a promotional video.

        In 2023/2024, my dedication and effort significantly grew. As a result,
        I was rewarded with the opportunity to join a free Front-End Developer
        course and contribute to multiple projects under a signed agreement.
        This experience gave me valuable exposure to real-world teamwork and
        project delivery.

        After completing my education, I had the chance to share my success
        story with senior professionals and audiences who were eager to hear
        about my journey. Through these experiences, I not only strengthened my
        technical knowledge but also developed essential soft skills such as
        empathy, strategic thinking, business acumen, and a client-oriented
        mindset.

        MERN stack, while continuously improving myself in the programming
        world.
